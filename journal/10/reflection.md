# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week, even though we were learning something new I feel like I was understanding the material- just in a different form. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I loved how we work with data in this way with SQL because it seems way more intuitive. 
- What are you struggling with?
I am still struggling with confidence and my ability to do this code without an example sitting right in front of me. Also- I am worried about getting the projects done on time. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I would count it as a victory that I am as far as I am on this assignment. I feel good about what I have accomplished so far.
