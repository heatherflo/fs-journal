# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I was really happy how this week went. I didn't have a ton of homework. All the time I spent working on the pre-work really helped me understand the items in the docket this week and watching the instructors do it again helped to solidify a ton in my mind.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I learned how to make text boxes and transparent/opaque types of boxes. 
- What are you struggling with?
I struggled this week working in a group. I also struggle with d-flex and learning where things are supposed to be on a page. But my nemesis this week has been images. I need to learn all the things related to images to make my life easier. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I would absolutely count it as a victory that I felt pretty confident this week on the material. I don't want to sound to cocky because the material still took me a long time to get through but I was able to figure out 90% of things on my own before asking for help.
