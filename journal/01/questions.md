# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Git gives us the ability to work on the same code and save our changes along the way. It also gives us the ability to work with others on the same code and save changes at the same time. We can look at our history and see the changes we have made or go back to old code if something has gone wrong. 

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > It is used to make a new directory or a new folder in the system. you do this when you want to start a new project. 

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > Pseudo-classes are differences in style when you perform an action. Example, when you hover over a button, the color may change. Some common examples are the button example or a highlighted text over a link. 

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is the ability to weigh your design in order of importance. the items with a higher specificity will override the other rules targeting the same elements. I can imagine we could use these to hide and un-hide elements or properties on the elements based on actions taken on a web page.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > If we overuse this feature we may confuse the code. It may not know which element to factor in as the most important and fail to do either.  

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > The selector: targets specific elements in the document such as the 
      body, the header, the footer, etc. 
      The property: the property within the selector we want to target such as the color or the font or the size of something. 
      The value: the value at which we want that property to be set at- listing the actual color the actual font name or the the actual size.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Website design that is pleasing to look at, easy to read and understand, will always be favored over sites that are not. Our brains find certain things pleasing such as composition and color and most of that is sub-conscious. Through design alone we can help people form thoughts on purchases, influence the way they navigate the site and really "tell" them where to go next. For websites that have a function they want people to accomplish (i.e. read this, buy me, see me) the placement of buttons, colors or other elements can influence where people visit on the site next to do the desired actions by the site maker. 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing allows developers to show the "frame" of a website page before building out the code so that you can see the design beforehand. 

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I would think that wireframing would be a great tool to make your process of coding faster, allowing us to see the overall design before we make miniscule changes within the code. If, however, wireframes are designs that are routine and typical and used often, I could see how this would be a disservice to the business or the person wanting a design that is unique and different from typical websites. But for the sake of speed, I would think that this is a great way to start a website from scratch if you don't have any specific needs for that website. 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > Flex properties are such they allow you to move the elements around in your "box" without using CSS. You can align them in any which way you please, move them around and even space them the way you'd like. 

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > In order to change the size you need to change the height and width of the property.
