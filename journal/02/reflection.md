# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
 I worked all break on concepts and tried to look ahead. That really seemed to help me understand the concepts we started learning this week .  

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

- What are you struggling with?
Mid-week: Really struggling with the topics. Understanding them as they come, but recalling them is hard. Even though I practiced all last week, I was really stressed out on Monday when I couldn't get basic design down for the website before even starting to code for function in JS.

- What would you count as a victory?
