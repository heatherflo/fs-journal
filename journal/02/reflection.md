# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
 I worked all break on concepts and tried to look ahead. That really seemed to help me understand the concepts we started learning this week . I also took a break mid-week that I think helped me refresh. I didn't try and put too much information into my brain over what I was learning in the lectures and it helped me focus on those concepts first. That being said- I found out that just by repeating this over and over again, I will eventually get the concepts and that helped my mental state. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get these concepts down.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
It was a surprised to find that after seeing this material a lot I was still struggling. There were so many methods and functions that require different ways of thinking. And while that is the whole point, I think I have to remember that this may be harder than I expect and 
I need to just do lots and lots of examples to get the hang of these concepts.

- What are you struggling with?
Mid-week: Really struggling with the topics. Understanding them as they come, but recalling them is hard. Even though I practiced all last week, I was really stressed out on Monday when I couldn't get basic design down for the website before even starting to code for function in JS.

My other issue this week was that I did not understand some of the game concepts and couldn't grasp the function of each button (pseudo-code) before trying to write the code. I am not a gamer and I had to figure out what the roll of each function was supposed to be before writing it.  

- What would you count as a victory?

This week, I feel like I worked better with one other person in my partner group instead of 2 others. It really helped only hear two people's ideas rather than 3.
