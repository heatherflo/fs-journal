# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week did not go as I had planned. Even after feeling super confident about the checkpoint, I failed making this my second failure of the course. I am at risk of failing the course. This is scary and makes me have to make a decision about what to do. 

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
This week I learned that I am not actually dumb when it comes to whiteboard problems. I absolutely am scared of them though. haha

- What are you struggling with?
This week I am not struggling with the idea of the back end- the database service model is really easy for me to understand at this point. I get the flow of the node.js circle/cycle. What I am struggling with is a little bit with the POST/PUT/PUSH methods within the front end client application process. A little review is all I need to clarify some things. 

- What would you count as a victory?
When Mick and Jeremy were going over the whole backend and front end from start to finish today- I really did understand and know how to write 80% of the code without having a reference in front of me. That made me proud because it really does tell me that I can do this.
