# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

This week I felt as though I was grasping the idea of the material fairly well. The more we tack on to the concepts, of course it has become harder, but I am really feeling confident in this material. I may not be able to recall every item I need to within the code or catch all the mistakes but I am understanding what the different levels/folders are for an what happens in them. 

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

This week I didn't learn  much that shocked or surprised me. I am cautiously being optimistic about how well I am doing. 

- What are you struggling with?

Right now I am struggling with making sure I have all my 'ducks in a row' and making sure all my layers are doing what they are supposed to be doing. 

- What would you count as a victory?

This week I had a tutor session with Jeremy and I really started grasping the idea of what I messed up on last week doing my checkpoint. While I didn't get it all right- I also worked really hard on it and I call that a victory. I am not giving up.
