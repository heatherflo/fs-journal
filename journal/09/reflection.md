# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week I really enjoyed learning some of the different paths people have gone down after graduation. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Not much
- What are you struggling with?
I am struggling with how to make a landing page for my github. Talking about yourself and designing it in a compelling way is hard.  
- What would you count as a victory?
My team is getting more work done on our capstone and I have successfully decided where I would like to be in the world of programming as I look for jobs.
