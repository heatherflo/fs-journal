# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week, as things progress with the capstone project, I am finding it easier to see the entire process of full-stack application. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I didn't really learn anything shocking or surprising.  
- What are you struggling with?
I am struggling to work with my team. Communication is difficult but I am pushing through and trying to be kind to myself and others during this experience. 
- What would you count as a victory?
I will take the victory that we are as far as we are on the project right now even though we have had difficulties communicating.
