# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week I was started out with a lot of my project done and I was pretty comfortable with the spot I was in. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
Not much...
- What are you struggling with?
I am still struggling with how to write the many to many relationships. I think I understand the actual relationship but I am afraid that I won't be able to do the logic behind them when it comes down to doing the final. 
- What would you count as a victory?
While I was upset that I didn't finish the zero point checkpoint, I also know that I did my best and I still overcame some challenges with it. So I am proud of myself.
