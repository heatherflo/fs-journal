# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
This week, I felt super confident after passing my checkpoint. I didn't really have too much trouble understanding the material logic that felt good. However, I was worried going into the checkpoint as I didn't think I had completed enough of it to pass. Passing made me feel like I knew more than I was giving myself credit for and that I need not be so hard on myself.    

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
This week, I learned that eventually we may be working with hundreds of files at one time and that sounded very scary. 

- What are you struggling with?
As confident I was this week thinking I was doing well- I really went through a hard time because I was struggling really hard on the material. I also have been struggling a lot with the white board wednesday problems. I have a hard time solving functions and I am not sure how to move past it. 

- What would you count as a victory?
I was super happy I passed the checkpoint after having such a hard weekend thinking Iw as about to fail again.
