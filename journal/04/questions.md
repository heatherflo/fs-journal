# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > Asynchronous code runs in the background of a webpage without having to reload the webpage- therefore making things faster and easier to load. 

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener is a function that is run specifically when you want to 'wait' for something to happen so it can respond when it's ready. It listens for the callback functions orders and tell it when its ready. 

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > A callback is a function that executes when it knows something has happened. The listener tells it something has happened and then it can run. A higher order function is when you put in one or more functions in as arguments.  

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > A promise is a function that will run and give you two possible outcomes. 1: that the function may run and be completed (get a response) or 2. that the function may run and be rejected. If to capture an error from a promise you can 'catch' it using the try/catch method. 

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?
                                                                                                        
  > The promise must be an async function to start. Then tacking on 'await' will give the function the ability to wait for another function/order to be completed before coming back.
